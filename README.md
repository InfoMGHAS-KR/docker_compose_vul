# Dependabot Docker Compose Support Demo

## Setup (before the demo)

1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Add the example `docker-compose.yml` file to the root directory
3. Configure Dependabot by adding the `.github/dependabot.yml` file
4. Wait for Dependabot to create PRs or manually trigger a check

## Demo Script

### Introduction

"Today we're demonstrating a new Dependabot feature that allows automatic updates for Docker Compose dependencies. This is particularly valuable for teams using Docker Compose in their development and deployment workflows."

### Demo Part 1: The Problem

"Let's look at a typical Docker Compose file:"

*Show the docker-compose.yml file*

"Notice that we're using specific versions for our images:
- Node 16.14.0
- Postgres 14.2
- Redis 6.2.6

These versions can quickly become outdated, which might lead to:
- Missing security patches
- Performance improvements
- New features
- Compatibility issues with other tools

Until now, developers had to manually check for updates to these images and update their Docker Compose files."

### Demo Part 2: Configuring Dependabot

"Now let's see how to configure Dependabot to automatically monitor and update these dependencies:"

*Show the dependabot.yml file*

"The key elements of this configuration are:
- We specify 'docker-compose' as the package ecosystem
- We set the directory where our docker-compose.yml file is located
- We schedule weekly checks for updates
- Optionally, we can limit which images to update
- We can also group updates together to minimize disruption"

### Demo Part 3: Dependabot in Action

*Show actual Dependabot PRs or screenshots if available*

"When Dependabot identifies newer versions of the Docker images in our compose file, it automatically creates pull requests to update them.

Let's look at an example PR:
- Dependabot has detected that Node 16.14.0 can be updated to 16.20.2
- The PR includes the changes to the docker-compose.yml file
- Release notes and changelog information are included in the PR description
- Any compatibility issues or breaking changes are highlighted

This automated process ensures our Docker images stay current without manual intervention."

### Demo Part 4: CI/CD Integration

"These Dependabot PRs integrate seamlessly with existing CI/CD workflows:
- Tests can automatically run against the updated images
- Preview environments can be spun up with the new dependencies
- Team members can review the changes before merging

This integration ensures that updates are properly vetted before being applied to production environments."

## Key Takeaways

1. Dependabot now supports Docker Compose as a package ecosystem
2. Setting up is as simple as adding a dependabot.yml configuration file
3. Image updates are proposed via pull requests with detailed context
4. The feature integrates with existing GitHub workflows and CI/CD pipelines
5. This automation saves time and improves security by keeping dependencies current
